# bearing-lifespan-simulation

A simple discrete-event simulation of machine bearing lifespans and replacement delays using **Python** and **SimPy**.  

The project models:
- Probabilistic bearing failures with different lifespan distributions  
- Random delays in replacement/repair  
- Cumulative system runtime tracking  

Simulation results are saved as an HTML table for easy viewing.
